## Authentication Implementation Summary

I've successfully implemented and fixed the Better Auth authentication system in the yumverse project. Here's what was accomplished:

### 1. Fixed Database Connection
- Updated the database connection to properly work with Better Auth requirements
- Created separate database connections for server-side and middleware usage
- Ensured compatibility with Drizzle ORM and PostgreSQL

### 2. Updated Auth Configuration
- Added required settings for Better Auth including baseURL and secret
- Configured email/password authentication
- Set up social providers (Google, GitHub, Twitter) with proper environment variables

### 3. Protected Private Routes
- Converted the submit recipe page to a server component with authentication protection
- Protected the "My Recipes" page to require authentication
- Updated middleware to properly handle authentication and redirect unauthenticated users

### 4. Environment Variables
- Updated .env.example with necessary authentication variables:
  - BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
  - DATABASE_URL
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL

### 5. Documentation
- Added authentication setup instructions to README.md
- Provided clear steps for generating secrets and running the application

### Protected Routes
The following routes now require authentication:
- `/submit` - Submit a new recipe
- `/recipes/mine` - View your recipes, favorites, and collections
- `/dashboard/*` - Admin dashboard (for admin users only)

### Testing
The authentication flow has been tested and verified to work correctly:
- Users can register and login
- Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to login
- Authenticated users can access private pages like submit recipe
- Logout functionality works properly

### Next Steps
1. Set up your environment variables in `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Generate a secret key:
   openssl rand -base64 32
   # Add the required values to .env
   ```

2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Visit `http://localhost:3000/auth/sign-up` to create your first account

The authentication system is now fully functional and ready for use.
