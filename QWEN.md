You are helping me redesign my recipe webapp project.  
The tech stack: Next.js (App Router + TypeScript), TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, Drizzle ORM with Postgres.  
Currently the design looks too generic like a SaaS landing page.  
I want you to make it **more unique, playful, and food-themed**, while keeping it clean and professional.

====================
🎨 Branding & Theme
====================
- Use a warm, playful palette: pastel pink (#F2C6DE), soft yellow (#F2C76E), fresh green (#9BD59B), warm orange (#FF9B73), and neutral background (#EBE8E7).
- Keep background gradient, but add subtle illustrations/patterns of food (vegetables, forks, pans).
- Rounded corners (xl–2xl) for a homey and friendly feeling.
- Icons only for main section headers and key buttons (not every word).

====================
🔝 Navbar
====================
- Items: Home, 🍲 Recipes, ⭐ Favorites, 📅 Meal Planner, About.
- Add CTA button: ➕ Add Recipe (highlighted).
- Hover effect: gradient underline animation.
- Keep Sign In / Sign Up, but styled softer, more modern.

====================
🥗 Hero Section
====================
- Show a big featured recipe card with full food photo (not SaaS screenshot).
- Background gradient + subtle food illustrations.
- Buttons:
  - View Recipe (primary)
  - ➕ Add Recipe (secondary)
  - 🎲 Surprise Me! (random recipe generator)
- Make it slightly interactive with hover/slide effect.

====================
📊 Stats Section
====================
- Display counters with animation (0 → 10k+).
- Each stat has a unique playful icon (Recipes, Cooks, Favorites, Rating).
- Different accent color for each card.

====================
🍳 Featured Recipes
====================
- Show real food images (replace SaaS placeholders).
- Cards hover: zoom-in + soft shadow.
- Add filter tabs (Quick Meals, Vegan, Trending, Desserts).
- Keep ratings, servings, difficulty visible.

====================
🍴 Categories Section
====================
- Replace plain tags with colorful grid cards:
  - 🍳 Breakfast
  - 🍔 Lunch
  - 🥗 Vegan
  - 🍰 Dessert
  - 🕒 Quick & Easy
- Use rounded colorful backgrounds, playful but minimal.

====================
⚙️ How It Works
====================
- Display 3 steps in a horizontal timeline with large icons:
  1. 🔍 Discover – Browse recipes
  2. 🍳 Cook – Follow step-by-step instructions
  3. 🤝 Share – Upload your own recipes
- Add vector illustrations (chef, ingredients, cooking scene).

====================
📩 Footer
====================
- Replace corporate SaaS links with foodie style:
  - Popular Recipes
  - Submit Recipe
  - Meal Planner
  - Blog
- Add Newsletter: "🍴 Get a recipe in your inbox every day".
- Add Social Feed preview (Instagram/TikTok of food images).
- Keep legal links small at the bottom.

====================
✨ Extra Features
====================
- 🎲 "I'm Hungry" button → random recipe generator.
- 📅 Meal Planner drag & drop → user drags recipe card into calendar.
- 📷 Community Photos → users upload photos of their cooked recipes under each recipe page.
- 🏆 Gamification → badges (👩‍🍳 Beginner, 🧑‍🍳 Chef Master).

====================
📌 TASK
====================
1. Refactor current pages/components to match the above design & UX changes.  
2. Replace placeholder content/images with real recipe-style placeholders (e.g. pasta, pancakes, salads).  
3. Implement Tailwind + shadcn UI components for:
   - Navbar with minimal icons
   - Featured recipe hero
   - Animated counters
   - Recipe grid with hover zoom
   - Category grid with icons
   - Timeline steps (How It Works)
   - Footer with newsletter & social feed
4. Make sure styling is consistent, responsive, and feels fun but not childish.  
5. Keep it optimized for SEO, accessibility, and performance.  

====================
⚡ Final Output
====================
- Return updated Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn code for all the above sections.  
- Include necessary Tailwind config updates (colors, font sizes).  
- Use Drizzle ORM queries only if needed for demoing recipes/categories.
